My name is Yun (Catherine) Cheng. I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Princeton University, advised by [Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/). I completed my M.S. in Machine Learning, B.S. in Computer Science, and B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University.

My current research interests include conceptual understanding of LLMs/VLMs and representation learning.
